# NNS Proposal Submission Dapp

This dapp makes submitting NNS proposals easy for non-technical users with the lowest cost possible. You can find the front end by visiting [nnsproposal.icp.xyz](https://nnsproposal.icp.xyz/) or [uf2fn-liaaa-aaaal-abeba-cai.ic0.app](https://uf2fn-liaaa-aaaal-abeba-cai.ic0.app/).

## Documentation & Instructions (WIP)

Right now I'm just getting the Dapp functional and testing it, but before the 10/12/2022 I expect to have full documentation available! At that point, this README will include all the information you'd need to understand and replicate this Dapp. Thank you for your patience!
